# work-day
Web Application to organize your work day using day.js

## Project Description
Create a simple calendar application that allows users to manage their daily schedule effectively. The application runs in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The starter code uses the Day.js library for working with date and time, but developers are encouraged to use a different JavaScript solution if preferred.
